# Hotel-Booking-Demands

# Introduction

This dataset has been found on Kaggle (httpswww.kaggle.comdatasetsjessemostipakhotel-booking-demand) under CC 4.0 licence. It contains information about hotel rooms, what kind of a hotel is it, when the guests arrived and left, etc.

# Analysis information

I performed EDA (Explorative Data Analysis) and predictive modelling using linear regression model, to check three questions:
1) what is the best time to book a hotel room?
2) What is the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate?

Tools used - Tableau, Excel, R(Studio)
